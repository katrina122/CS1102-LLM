                    <h2>History LLMs</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1960s, according to David (2023), the worldâ€™s first chatbot Eliza was created by Joseph Weizenbaum,
                            which gave the foundation and guidance of natural language processing for the future production of more complex LLMs. </li>
                        <li>1997, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks came into existence.</li>
                        <li>When LLMs first emerged, they were created using RNN models with LSTMs and GRUs.(Chandrakant,2024)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2> major technological breakthroughs</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Transformers' scalability has led to breakthroughs in language models.LLMs contain upwards of 100B parameters.</li>
                        <li> generate the text quickly and the use of LLMs were seen to be enabling human creativity and 
                            productivity in language and art like never before. (David, 2023)
</li>
    
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <h2>broad application areas of LLMs</h2>
                        <li>LLMs are widely used in human life, the most common applications are in education, industry, and some training.</li>
                        <li>According to Moore et al.(2022) ,LLMs that make use of produced Natural language processing (NLP) has significantly advanced thanks to pre-trained transformers (GPT), 
                            which have also sparked the creation of numerous language-based applications. </li>
                        <li>For example, the City University of Hong Kong provided chatgpt-4 to students to give instant feedback 
                            on the educational content and some companies use the robot in LLMs to automatically reply the repeated and simple messages. </li>
                        <li>As LLMs have excellent problem-solving skills, contextual awareness, advanced language comprehension,
                            and human-like text production capabilities, it is popular in many areas</li>
